# Build requirements for Biopython wheels
#
# To ensure only a numpy wheel is used (not a locally
# compiled numpy), this is installed with:
#
# pip install --only-binary :all: requirements.txt
#
# The point of this requirements.txt file is to specify
# an older numpy for each version of Python to maximise
# compatibility of our wheels (they should then work on
# that version of numpy or newer).
